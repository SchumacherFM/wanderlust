# Contributing

If you've found a bug, want to improve the current dashboard or use a new tool to help with workflow, feel free to submit and issue or pull request. Please check to see whether it's already been discussed though.

I'm fully open to all new ideas and improvements, however please keep in mind the aim of this dashboard is to be as simplistic and clean as possible with no bloat:
* Avoid using plugins/3rd party libaries
* Ensure your code works cross (major) browsers - Chrome, Firefox & IE11+ (CSS3 support)
* Ensure your code works on all screen sizes. [Chrome Emulation](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode) is handy here!
* If you're working with CSS, ensure the LESS files are also created, and visa versa.
* The build system of choice is [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
* The package manager of choice is [Bower](http://bower.io/).

## Issues/Features

Please be as descriptive as possible when submitting an issue or feature. Include your browser/device name plus version and if possible a screenshot. A 'how to replicate the issue' is always handy!

## Pull Requests

Even though the repository can be fast moving, ensure your PR is up to date with the latest master version.
If submitting a new feature which requires testing (as opposed to a small CSS tweak), create a new branch with a relevant name and submit this with your PR.
