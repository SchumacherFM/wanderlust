            <p>Any data you enter in the web interface will be stored on the server where Wanderlust is running. You are responsible for that data security.</p>
            <p>Any request which the Wanderlust app performs to external websites will reveal the IP address of you server.</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Wanderlust gathers and uses Users data when they visit the Wanderlust interface.</p>

            <h3 id="toc-website-visitors">Website Visitors</h3>

            <p>Like most website operators, Wanderlust collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
              available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Wanderlust’s purpose in
              collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Wanderlust’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Wanderlust
              may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

            <p>Wanderlust also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Wanderlust does not use such
              information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
              discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

            <h3 id="toc-gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

            <p>Certain visitors to Wanderlust’s websites choose to interact with Wanderlust in ways that require Wanderlust to gather personally-identifying
              information. The amount and type of information that Wanderlust gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
              use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, Wanderlust collects such information only as is necessary or appropriate to
              fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Wanderlust. Wanderlust does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
              described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
              engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

            <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

            <p>Wanderlust will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. </p>

            <p>Wanderlust takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially
              personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

            <p>Wanderlust posts its tracking information to the script on the host <i>https://ssl.webpack.de/www.schumacher.fm/piwik/piwik.php</i>.
            Due to a intentionally misconfiguration of Piwik the Piwik system only saves the IP address of the ssl.webpack.de server. This might change in
              the future.</p>

            <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

            <p>Wanderlust may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Wanderlust may reveal how many downloads a
              particular version got, or say which versions are most popular.</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>

            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each
              time the visitor returns. Wanderlust uses cookies to help Wanderlust identify and track visitors, their usage of Wanderlust website, and their
              website access preferences. Wanderlust visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
              cookies before using Wanderlust’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Wanderlust’s websites may not function properly without the
              aid of cookies.</p>

            <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Wanderlust may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Wanderlust’s sole discretion.
              Wanderlust encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any
              change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
